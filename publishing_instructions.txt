Steps To Publish Package To Windows Store: 
1. associate app with store
2. modify the packaging project to remove any lingering keys that will conflict with  signing
3. publish the package without signing
4. on my PC, navigate to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.19041.0\x64"
5. open powershell at this location
6. Run this command: $AppPath = "<msix file path>"
7. Run this command: $StagingFolder = "<unpacked files target path>"
8. Run this command: .\makeappx.exe unpack /p "$AppPath" /d "$StagingFolder"
9. Navigate to your newly unpacked files
10. Copy/paste the files from this path: C:\Users\duban\source\GameDevRepos\SWTORCombatParser\Orbs Package Builder\PathFixingCode
11. Modify the AppManifest.xml to have these: Executable="PSFLauncher32.exe" EntryPoint="Windows.FullTrustApplication"
12. Run this command: .\makeappx.exe pack /p "$AppPath" /d "$StagingFolder"
-------- if debugging and need to sign ----------
13. Run this command: $CodeSigningCert = "C:\Users\duban\source\GameDevRepos\SWTORCombatParser\TestCert.pfx" (or whatever path your cert you want to sign is)
14. Run this command: $CodeSigningPass = "<password>"
15. Run this command: .\signtool.exe sign /v /fd sha256 /f $CodeSigningCert /p $CodeSigningPass $AppPath

The package is now signed and if the certificate is in the correct location you should be good to install it.
